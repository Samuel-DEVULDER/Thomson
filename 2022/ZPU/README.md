# What

A ZPU virtual processor capable of adressing the whole TOx memory, and able to run C code generated by gcc.

ZPU is a 32 bit stack-based processor. Its opcodes are just 1 byte long. There exist a C compiler for it (gcc). This makes it the perfect cpu et emulate on an 8 bit machines.

# Status

work in progress.
