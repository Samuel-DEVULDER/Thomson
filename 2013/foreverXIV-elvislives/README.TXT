Category:   Demo

Features:   More than 40 pictures of Elvis and friends converted to

Machine(s): Thomson TO8, TO9+. It might work on TO7(+16k), TO7/70 and
            TO9 as well (I can't really test: emulators fail to correctly 
            emulate the disk controllers of these old machines). If the 
            disk loading fails for some reason, you might meet the guru
            just like on the plain old Amiga!
            
Format:     Autoboot disk. Just go into the basic and the demo will
            start.
Packer:     Modification of Exomizer2 to handle thomson images more
            efficiently. The achieved compression ratio is about 50% 
            the size of the native data (16k).
Remarks:    Pressing ctrl-c will jump to the boot menu. Pressing
            space will break the waiting loop and directly load the
            next image.
            
            Finished 2nd at the Forever 14 party in the "other platform
            demo" competition.
            
            The version in elvisliv.sap is an improved version of the one 
            presented at the party. The images now remain displayed for 
            a fixed amount of time, and graphics looks nicer (converter 
            has been inproved). Use elvisliv_orig.sap to get the original
            version.
